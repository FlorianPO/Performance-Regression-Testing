** Overview
*** Intro
    Collective Mind technology (cM) attempts to fill in this gap
    (often either covering very narrow research topics and too
    simplistic (just data and code sharing) or very formal and still
    require special programming skills often including Object Oriented
    Programming) by providing researchers and companies a simple, portable,
    technology-neutral and practically transparent way to gradually
    systematize and classify all their data, code and tools.
